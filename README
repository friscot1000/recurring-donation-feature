## ○ describes the process and rationale behind the solution you have submitted
### There are 3 files, DonationManager, Donor and Campaign.
### In the constructor we instantiate 3 objects.  campaigns, donors and filename.
### We use the main method to call the constructor in DonationMmanager then we call user_input from that object.
### In the User_input method we iterate over the text file and have some conditions to check if keyworks are in the string.
### If any of the keywords are detected we then add a donor, campaign or make a donation.
### Once everything is set I call the write_donor() and write_campaigns() methods to create the output.txt file.
