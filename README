# recurring-donation-feature

This repository contains a solution for a recurring donation feature. The solution allows for the management of donors, campaigns, and donations.

## Building and Running the Solution

### Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/friscot1000/recurring-donation-feature.git
```

### Run the Solution
From the root directory, run the following command:
```
./gfm-recurring input.txt
```

The results will be stored in the output folder in the output.txt file.

## Testing the Solution

To test the solution, follow the steps outlined in the previous section to build and run the solution. Once the solution is executed, you can examine the output.txt file to verify the correctness of the results.

## Solution Overview

The solution consists of three main files: DonationManager, Donor, and Campaign.

In the constructor, three objects are instantiated: campaigns, donors, and filename. The main method is used to call the constructor in DonationManager, and then the user_input method is called from that object.

Within the user_input method, the solution iterates over the text file and checks for specific keywords in each string. If any of the keywords are detected, a donor, campaign, or donation is added accordingly.

Once all the necessary data is processed, the write_donor() and write_campaigns() methods are called to create the output.txt file.

This solution provides a way to manage recurring donations by handling donors, campaigns, and their interactions.
